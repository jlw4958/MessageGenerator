# MessageGenerator

## Description
A friend of mine sent me a TikTok where someone basically looped through the alphabet in order to print out a prompted message and said "You should do this."

So I did.

Except, I wanted things to be a bit more interesting, so I added some other functionality to the program.
- Enter your own message!
- Sign in and see your message exclusively!
- Edit your message, delete it even!

She's currently still in the works, but I've got some important core functionality working for the visual aspect of the message delivery.
Check back to see if the task list has been updated ;-)

Feel free to look at my notes to see my funky little thought process~
